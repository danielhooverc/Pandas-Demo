# Pandas-Demo

#Demo Project: Data Engineering with Pandas and Numpy
*This demo project demonstrates data engineering tasks using Pandas and Numpy for Excel data manipulation.

#Features
*Data Upload: Upload Excel data for processing.
*Data Split and Filter: Split and filter the uploaded data.
*Data Cleaning: Clean the data and perform necessary transformations.
*Data Grouping and Statistics: Perform grouping and statistical operations on the cleaned data and output the results to an Excel file.
Modules

#The project consists of four modules:

*BDS_Main: The main program that coordinates the data engineering tasks.
*loadData: Responsible for data uploading.
*filterData: Handles data splitting and filtering operations.
*groupBy: Performs data grouping and generates the result file.

#Requirements
*To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Pandas
Numpy
Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using the following command:
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy
Run the BDS_Main.py script to execute the data engineering tasks.
Usage
Ensure you have the Excel data file ready for processing.
Run the BDS_Main.py script, which will prompt you to upload the Excel data.
The data will be split and filtered according to your requirements.
The cleaned data will be grouped and summarized.
The final results will be stored in an Excel file for further analysis.
Feel free to modify and extend the functionality to suit your specific data engineering needs.
